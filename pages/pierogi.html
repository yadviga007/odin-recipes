    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <h5>Filling</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1/3 cup chopped onion</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups sauerkraut, drained and minced</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chopped onion</li>
        <li>2 cups cold mashed potatoes</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Dough</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>3 egg</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) container sour cream</li>
        <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
    </ul>
<h4>Directions step by step</h4>
<ol>
    <li>To prepare the sauerkraut filling, melt the butter in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the onion, and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the drained sauerkraut and cook for an additional 5 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper, then remove to a plate to cool.</li>
    <li>For the mashed potato filling, melt the butter in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the onion, and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir into the mashed potatoes, and season with salt and white pepper.</li>
    <li>To make the dough, beat together the eggs and sour cream until smooth. Sift together the flour, salt, and baking powder; stir into the sour cream mixture until dough comes together. Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface until firm and smooth. Divide the dough in half, then roll out one half to 1/8 inch thickness. Cut into 3 inch rounds using a biscuit cutter.</li>
    <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add perogies and cook for 3 to 5 minutes or until pierogi float to the top. Remove with a slotted spoon.</li>
